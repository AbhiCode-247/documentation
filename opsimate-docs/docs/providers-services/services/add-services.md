# Add Services

Add and configure services for monitoring across your providers.

## Basic Flow

Adding services is done using the **Add Services** button in the menu that opens when clicking the three-dots icon.

1. **Go to “My Provider” Page**  
   Open the **My Provider** page in your OpsiMate dashboard.

2. **Access the Menu**  
   Click the **three‑dots** menu icon for the chosen provider.

3. **Add Services**  
   Select **Add Services** from the menu options.

4. **Select Services**  
   Choose the services you want to connect and manage.

5. **Start Managing**  
   Confirm your selection. OpsiMate will now let you monitor and control these services.

Based on the provider, you can select the services that are relevant to that specific provider.



## Next Steps

After adding your services:

1. **[Monitor Services](../../services/managing-services)** - View service status and metrics
2. **[Set Up Alerts](../../monitoring/setting-up-alerts)** - Get notified of issues
3. **[Create Dashboards](../../dashboards/creating-dashboards)** - Visualize service health

Start with basic health checks and gradually add more sophisticated monitoring as you learn what works best for your services.
