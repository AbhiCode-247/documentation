# Incident Response

## Overview

OpsiMate's Incident Response feature helps teams quickly detect, respond to, and resolve incidents. By combining alerts, automated actions, and collaboration tools, OpsiMate streamlines the incident management process and reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR).

## Incident Lifecycle

<div className="incident-lifecycle">
  <div className="lifecycle-step detection">
    <h3>Detection</h3>
    <p>Incidents are detected through alerts from integrated monitoring systems</p>
  </div>
  <div className="lifecycle-step triage">
    <h3>Triage</h3>
    <p>Alerts are categorized and prioritized based on severity and impact</p>
  </div>
  <div className="lifecycle-step response">
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>Automated and manual actions are taken to address the incident</p>
  </div>
  <div className="lifecycle-step resolution">
    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <p>The incident is resolved and services are restored to normal operation</p>
  </div>
  <div className="lifecycle-step analysis">
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>Post-incident analysis identifies root causes and prevention measures</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Key Features

### Incident Detection

- **Multi-Tag Alerts**: Comprehensive alert visibility across all service tags
- **Alert Correlation**: Intelligent correlation of related alerts
- **Threshold Configuration**: Customizable thresholds for incident creation

### Incident Management

- **Incident Dashboard**: Centralized view of all active incidents
- **Severity Classification**: Automatic classification based on alert severity
- **Assignment**: Assign incidents to specific team members
- **Status Tracking**: Track incident status from detection to resolution

### Automated Response

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="create" label="Creating Actions" default>
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Restart Failed Service",
      "description": "Automatically restart a service that has failed",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "alert",
        "conditions": {
          "alertName": "Service Down",
          "severity": "critical"
        }
      },
      "steps": [
        {
          "type": "serviceOperation",
          "operation": "restart",
          "target": "${service.name}"
        },
        {
          "type": "notification",
          "channel": "slack",
          "message": "Service ${service.name} was automatically restarted"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="execute" label="Executing Actions">
    ```typescript
    // Example of action execution flow
    async function executeAction(action, context) {
      // 1. Validate action parameters
      const validationResult = validateActionParameters(action, context);
      if (!validationResult.valid) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid action parameters: ${validationResult.error}`);
      }
      
      // 2. Execute each step in sequence
      for (const step of action.steps) {
        await executeStep(step, context);
      }
      
      // 3. Record action execution result
      await recordActionExecution(action, context, 'success');
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Collaboration Tools

- **Incident Chat**: Real-time chat for incident responders
- **Knowledge Base**: Access to runbooks and documentation
